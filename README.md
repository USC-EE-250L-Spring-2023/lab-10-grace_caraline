## Lab Question Answers
Question 1: Under what circumstances do you think it will be worthwhile to offload one or both
of the processing tasks to your PC? And conversely, under what circumstances will it not be
worthwhile?
- If the PC has significantly better hardware + processing times, it is worthwhile to offload 
  processes to the pc because the processing time will be faster, however, if the hardware + 
  processing times of a PC is only slightly better, then it is likely not worthwhile to offload 
  the task(s) because the time for transfering the data will be significant compared to the 
  time potentially 'saved'
